# Icy Tower: The Board Game

A game I'm making as part of a school project. Put it up here so it'd have a convenient build process.

## Rules

### Setup

Shuffle the card deck and draw 3 cards. Set Harold the Homeboy at the 1st floor, and the crumble token below the first floor (Floor 0).

### Gameplay

Each turn, you play a card from your hand and then draw a new card from the deck.

 At the end of your turn the tower starts crumbling to bricks and dust, and the crumble token chases after you - it moves up 1 floor, and an additional floor for every 10 you've climbed (if you're on floor 11, it moves 2. Floor 21, it moves 3. You get the idea.)
