# Icy Tower: The Board Game

A game I'm making as part of a school project. Put it up here so it'd have a convenient build process.

## Rules

### Setup

Shuffle the card deck and draw 3 cards. Set Harold the Homeboy at the 1st floor, and the crumble token below the first floor (Floor 0).

### Gameplay

Each turn, you play a single card from your hand and then draw a new one from the deck. You could choose to play nothing and just pass your turn to draw a card.

Some of the cards you have are **Combo Cards** - every time you play a combo card, you climb an extra floor for every successive previous turn you played a combo card.

At the end of your turn the tower starts crumbling to bricks and dust, and the crumble token chases after you - it moves up 1 floor, and an additional floor for every 10 you've climbed (if you're on floor 11, it moves 2. Floor 21, it moves 3. You get the idea.)

If the tower crumbles where Harold is standing, it's game over!
