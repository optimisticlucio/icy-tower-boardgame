# Icy Tower: The Board Game

A game I'm making as part of a school project. Put it up here so it'd have a convenient build process.

## Rules

### Setup

Shuffle the card deck and draw 3 cards. Set Harold the Homeboy at the 1st floor, and the crumble token below the first floor (Floor 0).

### Gameplay

Each turn, you play a card from your hand and then draw a new card from the deck. You can choose to skip a turn to discard your entire hand and draw a new one.

Some of the cards you have are **Combo Cards** - if you play a combo card, you go up an extra step for every other combo card you've played before it in a row, up to 5 steps! (That's the max combo.)

At the end of your turn the tower starts crumbling to bricks and dust, and the crumble token chases after you - it moves up 1 floor, and an additional floor for every 10 you've climbed (if you're on floor 11, it moves 2. Floor 21, it moves 3. You get the idea.)

If the tower crumbles where Harold is standing, it's game over!
